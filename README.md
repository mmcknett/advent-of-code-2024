### Part 2
Proposal:

At each position in the run, see what would happen if an obstruction was placed in front of the guard vs not. The guard is in a loop if they step on the same location in the same orientation. They're *not* in a loop if they exit the board eventually.

This will be quadratic in the number of steps taken, so not great, but probably fast enough?
